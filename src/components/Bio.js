                    In 2018 I embarked on an exciting journey to New York City, and took
            Intro to Python head on <Label>print("Hello World")</Label> It
            has been quite the adventure since.
                    My curiousty led me to try this new thing that I had only heard about, my spontaneous side urged me to quit my 9-5 and pursue it
                    full time, and my dedication is what made me never look back.

                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time at home with my pets, reading mystery and horror novels, seeking out new
                    restaurants, making memories with friends, and working on hobbies and all types of projects from coding to crafting.

                    I've traveled around the world and am fascinated by culture, food,
                    and technology. I lived in Africa at a wildlife rehabilitation
                    center, making new friends, taking on leadership roles, and most
                    importantly, saving the lives of Africa's wildlife and fighting for

                    I am passionate and not afraid to take risks, yet am level headed
                    and can make quick decisions under pressure.

                    I am career focused and eager to learn new technologies and
                    languages. The most rewarding feeling is seeing something I have
            created come to life!</h2>
